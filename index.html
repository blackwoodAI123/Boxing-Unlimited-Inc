			</a> 
			<p>Boxing Shoes are shoes worn within the ring only. They have a thin sole, a low heel, and medium traction.
			The ankle support allows the athlete to pivot and slip without worrying about spraining ankles. </p>
			<dl>

				speed advantage. However, they offer little ankle support.</dd>

				<dd>Mid-Top Boxing Shoes provide a balance between a light feel and support. They are used by boxers with 
				a preference for movement.</dd>
				<dt>High-Top Boxing Shoes</dt>

			coordination, and cardio.</p>

				boxing mitt. They often have a hand mold or strap on the end to ensure good grip.</dd>
				<dt>Kicking Pads</dt>
				<dd>Kicking Pads are larger and also have dense and durable foam. They are curved and often used side by side
				due to the leg being bigger. These pads have larger handles as they must be gripped tightly and firmly to the
				body.</dd>

		<a href = "Headgear/headgear.html"><img src = "Headgear/Headgear.png" alt = "Headgear" width = "200" height = "200">

			<dl>
				<dt>Open Faced Headgear</dt>

				strikes. With minimal protection, this type of headgear should not be used by amateurs.</dd>
				<dt>Mexican Style Headgear</dt>
				<dd>Mexican Style Headgear is the same as Open Faced Headgear but with cheek protection. This reduces visibility
				but increases protection.</dd>
				<dt>Full Face Headgear</dt>

				and other professional workers use this headgear to reduce scarring and black eyes.</dd>

		<a href = "Bags/bags.html"><img src = "Bags/Bags.png" alt = "Bags" width = "200" height = "200">
			</a> 
			<p>Boxing Bags come in many different shapes and sizes and serve many different purposes.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Heavy Bag</dt>
				<dd>Heavy Bags are used for general training, conditioning, and power development. They can withstand heavy strikes
				and are generally used to teach new techniques.</dd>
				<dt>Speed Bag</dt>
				<dd>Speed Bags are used to develop rhythm, reflexes, and timing. They are not used for heavy strikes but for fast
				and repetitive strikes. They can increase punching speed, endurance, and coordination.</dd>
				<dt>Uppercut Bag</dt>
				<dd>Uppercut Bags are used to simulate clinch work. They simulate real striking angles for hooks and uppercuts. By
				getting close to this bag, one can simulate boxing clinch work without sparring.</dd>
				<dt>Banana Heavy Bag</dt>
				<dd>Banana Heavy Bags are usually only used for Muy Thai. They are designed for low kicks, knees, elbows, and clinch
				work.</dd>
				<dt>Body Opponent Bag</dt>
				<dd>Body Opponent Bags or BOBs are used to simulate an actual opponent. They are realistic designs of actual people
				and allow boxers to simulate a real opponent without training partners.</dd>
				<dt>Water Bag</dt>
				<dd>Water Bags are used to mimic the feel of punching a human. They are also used to reduce chances of injury from
				punching. These bags can also help develop power for hooks and uppercuts due to their shape.</dd>
				<dt>Double End Bag</dt>
				<dd>Double End Bags are used to develop timing and reflexes. The bag itself is small but unpredictable in it's movement.
				It engages the mind and body as the target is constantly dynamic. This unpredictable nature mimics a real opponent in the 
				ring.</dd>

		<div id = "Nutrition" class = "Advice">
		<a href = "Nutrition/nutrition.html"><img src = "Nutrition/Nutrition.png" alt = "Nutrition" width = "200" height = "200">
			</a> 
			<p>Boxing Nutrition is extremely important for even casual fighters.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Protein</dt>
				<dd>Protein is important for boxers as it repairs the muscle after heavy use. Boxers should eat 0.7 to 1 gram of protein
				per bodyweight.</dd>
				<dt>Fats</dt>
				<dd>Fats are also important as "fat is fuel". Healthy fats can improve energy, cardio, and overall quality of life. Healthy
				fats include olive oil, beef tallow, nuts, dark chocoalte, and many more.</dd>
				<dt>Carbohydrates</dt>
				<dd>Carbohydrates are another form of fuel for muscles. They can also improve energy and cardio. However, carbohydrates hold
				water which is an important factor for cutting weight.</dd>
				<dt>Cutting Weight</dt>
				<dd>Cutting Weight is only for professional fighters. Amateur Fighters should only cut 3 to 4 pounds maximum. Cutting weight
				involves getting rid of water in the body. To do this, fighters drink 2 to 2.5 Liters of water a week before the cut.
				Then a few days out from the cut, they stop eating carbohydrates and drinking water. From there, they employ various techniques
				to sweat out as much water as possible to make weight. After weighing in, the fighters gain all the weight back by drinking water and 
				using IV's.</dd>

		<a href = "Coaching/coaching.html"><img src = "Coaching/Coaching.png" alt = "Coaching" width = "200" height = "200">
			</a> 
			<p>Coaching in Boxing requires many years of experience in the ring. It also requries years of holding pads and shadowing current
			coaches. To become a quality coach, one must study boxing for years.</p>
			
			<p>To find a coach, visit different gyms across your local area. Try different free trials until you meet a coach which you like.
			Then, attend classes, open gym, and other seminars to improve your connection. After about a year, ask him about competitions to 
			further advance in boxing.</p>

			</a>

			the appropriate equitment, find trainers, and advertise.</p>

			</a> 
			<p>Learning Other Martial Arts is extremely important. Learning new things can balance out the body and mind while teaching the artist
			important lessons about their current martial art.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Wrestling</dt>
				<dd>Wrestling is an important martial art as it works the ground game, something boxing never touches. Wrestling is a tough and
				physically demanding sport in a different way than boxing.</dd>
				<dt>Kickboxing</dt>
				<dd>Kickboxing incoporates kicks as well as boxing. This is another aspect of martial arts boxing never covers. Kickboxing is
				similar to boxing but the feel of the sport is extremely different.</dd>
				<dt>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</dt>
				<dd>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is another martial art that works the ground game. However, it covers mainly submissions and defense rather
				than offensive pins and positions.</dd>
				<dt>Muy Thai</dt>
				<dd>Muy Thai incoporates elbows, knees, kicks, and punches as it is "Art of 8 Limbs". Muy Thai is more similar to kickboxing than 
				boxing.</dd>
