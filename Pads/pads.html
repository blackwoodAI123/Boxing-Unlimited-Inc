			<p>Boxing Pads are useful for all boxers with a coach or partner. Boxing Pads can cost anywhere from $15.00
			to $150.00. These can be used to train your punches timing and speed to get ready for a fight or improve coordination.

			may be cheap but they will not last long under pressure. <a href = "https://www.everlast.com/1910-micro-focus-mitts" target = "_blank">
			More quality pads</a> may be more expensive but often last years even in the most demanding of environments.</p>
			
			<p>Kicking Pads are useful to other martial artists. If you want to cross train, kicking pads are a great way to try out 
			something new. <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-RDX-Boxing-Strike-Curved/dp/B00GZKQ7WY/" target = "_blank">Kicking Pads</a>
			may seem similar to boxing pads but they are bigger, curved and offer more protection from powerful strikes. Kicking pads often cost
			anywhere from $20.00 to $200.00 but often vary greatly based on quality.</p>
