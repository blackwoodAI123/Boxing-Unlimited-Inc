		<p>Coaching in Boxing requires many years of experience in the ring. It also requries years of holding pads and shadowing current
			coaches. To become a quality coach, one must study boxing for years. Another important aspect of coaching is motivation. You
			must have internal motivation to become a coach as coaching can be a long, grueling, and frustrating process. On the flip side,
			you must also be able to motivate others. When coaching a boxer, they will have to push through hurt and pain to become the best
			they can be. A good coach will be able to motivate their fighter to become their best self.</p>
			
		<p>To find a coach, visit different gyms across your local area. Try different free trials until you meet a coach which you like.
			Then, attend classes, open gym, and other seminars to improve your connection. After about a year, ask him about competitions to 
			further advance in boxing. If there aren't any boxing gyms around you, try online coaching. Online coaching while relatively new,
			can work for lower tier fighters and casual trainers. Another way is to learn from youtube. Fighters like <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@CorySandhagenMMA">
			Cory Sandhagen</a>, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@HenryCejudoTripleC">Henry Cejudo </a>, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@Tony_Jeffries">Tony Jeffries</a>
			offer great advice for free on youtube. These types of coaching are not cheap. Boxing coaches routinely charge over $100.00 an hour
			as good boxing coaches are very rare.</p>
