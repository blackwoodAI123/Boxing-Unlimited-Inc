	<p class = "beginningInformation">Learning Other Martial Arts is extremely important. Learning new things can balance out the body and mind while teaching the artist
			important lessons about their current martial art. These new types of training can cost the same or more as Boxing training, anywhere
			from $100.00 per hour to $500.00 per hour.</p>

		<div id = "Wrestling">
			<img src = "Wrestling.png" alt = "WrestlingImg" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Wrestling is an important martial art as it works the ground game, something boxing never touches. Wrestling is a tough and
			physically demanding sport in a different way than boxing. Wrestling matches are intense and relatively short. Wrestling also 
			requires a training partner so look for one at your current boxing gym. Also, wrestling requires a special type of headgear that
			covers your ears to prevent califlour ear. </p>

		<div id = "Kickboxing">
			<img src = "KickBoxing.png" alt = "KickBoxingImg" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Kickboxing incoporates kicks as well as boxing. This is another aspect of martial arts boxing never covers. Kickboxing is
			similar to boxing but the feel of the sport is extremely different. There are no new purchases needed if you have boxing equitment
			already. Many boxing gyms also have kickboxing classes included so attending one would be a great first step. To further your
			education, watch youtube videos of kickboxing fights to learn timing, speed, and nuances of the sport.</p>

		<div id = "BrazilianJiuJitsu">
			<img src = "BJJ.png" alt = "BJJImg" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is another martial art that works the ground game. However, it covers mainly submissions and defense rather
			than offensive pins and positions. No additional gear is needed to start Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Boxing gyms often to not offer classes
			in BJJ so adventouring outside your gym may be needed. However, this risk is worth it as BJJ can change your perspecitve on boxing
			and competition in general.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "MuyThai">
			<img src = "MuyThai.png" alt = "MuyThaiImg" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Muy Thai incoporates elbows, knees, kicks, and punches as it is "Art of 8 Limbs". Muy Thai is more similar to kickboxing than 
			boxing. A few boxing gyms do offer Muy Thai but it is an anamoly. Traveling to Thailand is the best option to train in Muy Thai but
			many Thai practitioners have moved to the US and now offer classes. This type of fighting can change your perpecitve on distance,
			competition, and sparring.</p>
