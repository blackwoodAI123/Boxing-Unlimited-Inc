	<p class = "beginningInformation">Boxing Shoes are shoes worn within the ring only. They have a thin sole, a low heel, and medium traction.
			The ankle support allows the athlete to pivot and slip without worrying about spraining ankles. After 
			developing a style, the shoe you need will become clear. Boxing Shoes can cost anywhere from $50.00 to 
			$200.00 varying on the quality, size, and type of shoe. Another factor in purchasing shoes may be the 
			types of martial arts you train. Shoes are not needed for any other martial art besides boxing so these
			shoes may be obselete in other sessions.</p>
