	 <p class = "beginningInformation">Boxing Bags come in many different shapes and sizes and serve many different purposes. The price of a bag can range
		from $50.00 to $1000.00.</p>
	  <main id = "listOfBags">
		
		<div id = "HeavyBags" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "HeavyBag.png" alt = "Heavy Bag" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Heavy Bags are used for general training, conditioning, and power development. They can withstand heavy strikes
				and are generally used to teach new techniques.</p>
			
			<p>A <a href = "https://www.titleboxing.com/products/title-gel-intense-heavy-bag-striking-sleeve#">cheap heavy
			bag</a> won't last but will be a greate way to get started with training.</p>
			
			<p>A <a href = "https://www.everlast.com/elite-2-retail-heavy-bag?refSrc=16796&nosto=nosto-page-product2">mid range
			bag</a> will last long enough for most home gyms.</p>
			
			<p>A <a href = "https://www.modestvintageplayer.com/products/mvp-boxing-bag?variant=29836784909&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwk6SwBhDPARIsAJ59Gwc817yRP7tMciq25-YAoctVtDGDPKYw_clN03ZbhuKHjgrHUGCfUfkaAokfEALw_wcB">high end 
			bag</a> will last a a lifetime in a home gym and years in a boxing gym.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "SpeedBags" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "SpeedBag.png" alt = "Speed Bag" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Speed Bags are used to develop rhythm, reflexes, and timing. They are not used for heavy strikes but for fast
				and repetitive strikes. They can increase punching speed, endurance, and coordination.</p>
			
			<p>The price of a speedbag is largely irrelevant. A <a href = "https://www.titleboxing.com/products/title-complete-professional-adjustable-speed-bag-platform#">higher end speed bag</a>
			may last longer but relative to the price, it is not worth purchasing unless running a boxing gym. A <a href = "https://www.titleboxing.com/products/title-classic-super-speed-bag-v2#">
			lower end speed bag</a> however may come without a platform to hang it which may factor in to the cost.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "UppercutBag" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "UppercutBag.png" alt = "Uppercut Bag" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Uppercut Bags are used to simulate clinch work. They simulate real striking angles for hooks and uppercuts. By
				getting close to this bag, one can simulate boxing clinch work without sparring.</p>
				
			<p>An <a href = "https://www.ringsandcages.com/product-page/wall-mount-uppercut-hook-bag">uppercut bag</a>
			is not viable in home gyms due to it's specialized nature. In boxing gyms however, this type of bag is common.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "BananaHeavyBag" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "BananaHeavyBag.png" alt = "Banana Heavy Bag" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Banana Heavy Bags are usually only used for Muy Thai. They are designed for low kicks, knees, elbows, and clinch
				work.</p>
				
			<p>If training any other martial art besides Boxing, <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Muay-Thai-Banana-Heavy-Bag/dp/B00U4LTGKU?th=1">Banana Heavy Bags</a>
			should be used. They are thinner and offer more comfortable kicking potential than any heavy bag.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "BodyOpponentBag" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "BOB.png" alt = "BOB" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Body Opponent Bags or BOBs are used to simulate an actual opponent. They are realistic designs of actual people
				and allow boxers to simulate a real opponent without training partners.</p>
				
			<p>BOBs are very useful to emulate a real opponent but <a href = "hhttps://centurymartialarts.com/collections/bob/products/bob-body-opponent-bag">BOBs</a>
			aren't practical for home gyms and are useful but sparsely used in MMA and Kickboxing gyms.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "WaterBag" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "WaterBag.png" alt = "Water Bag" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Water Bags are used to mimic the feel of punching a human. They are also used to reduce chances of injury from
				punching. These bags can also help develop power for hooks and uppercuts due to their shape.</p>
				
			<p>Water Bags are typically only used in boxing gyms but <a href = "https://us.phantom-athletics.com/products/boxing-bag-hydro">Water Bags</a>
			offer a different aesthetic to a normal heavy bag.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id = "DoubleEndBag" class = "Bags">
		<img src = "DoubleEndBag.png" alt = "Double End Bag" width = "200" height = "200">
			<p>Double End Bags are used to develop timing and reflexes. The bag itself is small but unpredictable in it's movement.
				It engages the mind and body as the target is constantly dynamic. This unpredictable nature mimics a real opponent in the 
				ring.</p>
				
			<p><a href = "https://www.titleboxing.com/products/title-double-end-bag">Double End Bags</a> are a very useful bag in any boxers
			arsenal. Because they can be affordable, every serious boxer should have one in their home.</p>
