			<dt>Protein</dt>
			<dd>Protein is important for boxers as it repairs the muscle after heavy use. Boxers should eat 0.7 to 1 gram of protein
			per bodyweight. Some foods to help achieve this are steak, chicken, fish, turkey, and duck. Protein also keeps you full
			which is helpful when dieting down.</dd>
			<dt>Fats</dt>
			<dd>Fats are also important as "fat is fuel". Healthy fats can improve energy, cardio, and overall quality of life. Healthy
			fats include olive oil, beef tallow, nuts, dark chocolate, and many more. These types of fats are burned a lot in training
			so during the training camp, fighters usually consume more healthy fats than outside of camp.</dd>
			<dt>Carbohydrates</dt>
			<dd>Carbohydrates are another form of fuel for muscles. They can also improve energy and cardio. However, carbohydrates hold
			water which is an important factor for cutting weight. Some healthy carbohydrate sources include lentils, rice, potatoes,
			and grains. These are also used as fuel during training sessions so fighters usually eat carbohydrates before training.</dd>
			<dt>Cutting Weight</dt>
			<dd>Cutting Weight is only for professional fighters. Amateur Fighters should only cut 3 to 4 pounds maximum. Cutting weight
			involves getting rid of water in the body. To do this, fighters drink 2 to 2.5 Liters of water a week before the cut.
			Then a few days out from the cut, they stop eating carbohydrates and drinking water. From there, they employ various techniques
			to sweat out as much water as possible to make weight. After weighing in, the fighters gain all the weight back by drinking water and 
			using IV's.</dd>

		calculator</a> to ensure that you are on track to make the desired weight.</p>
