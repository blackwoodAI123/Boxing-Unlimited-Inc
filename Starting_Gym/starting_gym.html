			</p>To start a gym, capital is needed. The cost to open is anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 USD. Also, one must pick a location,
			the appropriate equitment, find trainers, and advertise.</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Location</dt>
				<dd>Location is an important part of any business. The location must be easily accessable, seen, and presentable. This will
				ensure potential customers passing through will be obliged to enter. Also, if the location is hard to find, potential customers
				may give up and find another gym.</dd>
				
				<dt>Equitment</dt>
				<dd>Picking the right equitment to buy is extremely important. Every dollar spent on equitment and maintenance is money that
				you must charge customers for using. Also, if the equitment easily breaks, current customers may become dissatified with the 
				options and change gyms. Another factor in choosing what equitment to buy is the classes, programs, and teaching style of the 
				instructor. For example, if the gym is a Muy Thai Gym, buy Banana Heavy Bags instead of Traditional Heavy Bags. Having the 
				right equitment for the customers is a key when opening any exercise gym.</dd>
				
				<dt>Trainers</dt>
				<dd>The main way many gyms make money is classes. Finding a trainer to teach these classes is very difficult. First, they must
				be a master at the martial art they are teaching. Second, they must learn to teach complete beginners who cannot comphrehend
				the concepts. This not only reveal the trainer's style of teaching but allow you to gauge the confidence of the trainer in his
				skills. After finding a good trainer, you must set up class times, sizes, and discuss pay or salary. A quality instructor is worth
				hundreds per hour which is why advertisements are so important.</dd>
				
				<dt>Advertisements</dt>
				<dd>Advertisement will allow you to gain customers who were never previously interested in martial arts. This type of targeted
				advertisement will allow you to reach new customers who have never done much exercise. Also advertise at different events such 
				as festivals, local fights, and fundraisers. This wil allow you to get a diverse customer base which ensures that the business
				is not reliant on a singular customer base.</dd>
