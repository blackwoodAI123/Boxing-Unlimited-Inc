		<p>Boxing Hoodies are used when cutting weight, warming up, and running. This is usually done to acclimate to a
				hot environment and keep the body warm. These hoodies can be purchased anywhere but most boxers have a
				hoodie for each training day. This is because they will get dirty after an hour or two of cutting weight
				for a fight.</p>
				
		<p>Boxing Shirts are usually used when training on the pads, heavy bag, or lifting. These shirts are usually 
				sweat wicking or dry fit shirts. Boxers usually carry multiple shirts per day as after training, the shirt
				will be dirty. Also, many serious boxers train multiple times per day so multiple shirts are a necessity.</p>
				
		<p>Boxing Shorts are worn throughout training. In the ring, Boxing Shorts are considered a part of the fighter's
				personality. They are often styled, flashy, and represent their heritage. Boxing Shorts outside the ring are 
				similar to their shirts. They are sweat wicking or dry fit and often cycled throughout the day. However,
				Boxing Shorts in the ring are a reflection of the fighter's confidence as the more decorated shorts usually
				means a higher payday.</p>
		
		<p>Most Boxing Clothes are relatively cheap with the price being anywhere from $10.00 to $50.00. Specialized boxing
		clothes however must be custom made which can drive the cost up to anywhere from $500.00 to $1000.00.</p>
